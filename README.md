# Workday-Scheduler

For this homework assignment I was tasked with creating a scheduling system displaying hour blocks from 9AM to 5PM. Each block would have the hour on the left side, a text block in the middle, and a save button on the right side. The current hour block would be red, the hours passed would be gray, and future hours of the day would be in green. Each text field would save to local storage when its coresponding save button is pressed. The current time is updated by info from the API moment.js and corresponds with the user's current system time. The current date is displayed at the top as well.

Here is a link to the deployed version: https://joshtrev.github.io/Workday-Scheduler/
